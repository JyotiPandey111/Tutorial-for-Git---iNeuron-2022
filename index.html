    <h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
    <p>You can use GitHub Pages to host a website about yourself, your organization, or your project directly from a repository on GitHub.com.</p>
    <p>You can create GitHub Pages sites that are publicly available on the internet. Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also publish sites privately by managing access control for the site.</p>
